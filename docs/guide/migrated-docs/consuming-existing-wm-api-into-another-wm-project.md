You can Import REST API endpoints via Open API/Swagger import feature.

In this document, see how you can use an API of an existing WaveMaker app into another WaveMaker app in just a few simple steps.

:::note
This document assumes that you have a sample HRDB imported in your project. For more information, see [Connect to a sample DB](/docs/apis-and-services/apis/database-and-crud-apis/#connect-to-a-db).
:::

## Download Swagger from a WaveMaker Project

- Click **File Explorer**.
- Go to the following path `services/hrdb/designtime/hrdb_API.json`
- Download the file.

## Import Swagger into another Project

Import the downloaded swagger into another WaveMakar project. For more information on how to import, see [Importing REST APIs via Swagger](#).

## Enter Host Name and Base Path

You will need the host name and base path when you import an API via [Swagger Import](#).

:::note
Ensure that the application is deployed before you could use the API. For more information on how to deploy an app, see [One-Click Deployment](/docs/build-and-deploy/deploy/one-click deployment).
:::

![updating host and basepath](/learn/assets/update-host-basepath.png)

- Enter the **Host Name**. The host is the URL where the app is hosted. For example, `hostid.cloud.wavemakeronline.com/yourappname`.
- Enter the **Base Path**. For example, `/services` is the basepath for HRDB.
- Click **Save**.

The WaveMaker app's API is ready to consume in your project.
