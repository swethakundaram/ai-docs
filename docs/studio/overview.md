# Platform Overview

WaveMaker platform offers acceleration for web and mobile application development teams focused in building highly customized, scalable and secure app solutions.

WaveMaker enables large organizations building several multi-platform app solutions that require collaboration across engineering, design, customer implementation and partner development teams. In such highly collaborative and cross-functional environments, WaveMaker platform provides alignment in terms of:
- Technology stack
- Design systems
- Development best practices
- Composability & reusability
- Seamless integration with existing SDLC processes

WaveMaker platform focuses on 3 key areas to provide acceleration to large teams:
1. **Design to code automation**, creates a working Design System for developers
2. **Squad of AI Agents** for SDLC workflows, with standards based app generation
3. **Integrated Studio** experience to develop, test, configure & deploy apps

![Three Pillars](../release-notes/release-version-1/assets/images/1-ThreePillar.png)

## 1. Design to code Automation
Autocode converts Figma designs to application artifacts using AI, by generating a comprehensive set of Design Tokens that are mapped to UI component library. Autocode identifies components using AI and maps them to the corresponding WaveMaker UI components. 

WM UI library has evolved over the past decade supporting complex customization, security, accessibility and modern experience needs. Components are built for popular UI frameworks such as Angular, React for web & React Native for mobile.

WaveMaker uses a highly sophisticated 2-pass generation technique to make AI conversion predictable and reliable.
- **1st pass** - Figma designs are translated to an intermediate WaveMaker meta markup language (WML), which identifies UI Components, properties and design tokens using AI/LLM
- **2nd pass** - WaveMaker Markup (WML) is then converted to working Angular, React or React Native app code, using WaveMaker code generators and LLMs

## 2. Developer Agents for App Generation
AI Agents provide accelerated developer workflows with significant skill reduction, without needing developers to deal with nuances of the underlying UI framework, architecture or LLMs. Using simple textual prompts, developers build web and mobile app capabilities:
- Generate pages by converting designs from Figma design file, screenshot and text prompt
- Generate layouts, components, pages, backend-for-frontend APIs
- Bind UI components to APIs, & generate UI event handling logic
- Add Wizard & Form field-level validations
- Configure Single sign-on, API tokens & RBAC support
- Implement i18n, message bundles & translation
- Implement BFF APIs and microservices
- Javascript & Java code completion

WaveMaker platform provides a flexible agent framework, to create custom agents for specialized dev tasks which are specific to organization, use cases and business scenarios.

## 3. WYSIWYG Studio for Authoring and finer control
WaveMaker markup language (WML) not only simplifies AI code generation, it has enabled developers to visually create layouts, drag-n-drop components and fine-tune their look-n-feel requirements. Over the years, WML evolved and enabled developing highly customizable ISV solutions and enterprise applications.

WYSIWYG Studio provides human-in-the-loop control for developers when extensively using automation with LLMs and agents, to course correct and refine AI generated output. Studio offers visual validation of development activities and better collaboration across design, engineering and business teams.
