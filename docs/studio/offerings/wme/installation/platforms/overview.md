This guide provides an overview of the process for setting up **WaveMaker Enterprise (WME)** across supported deployment platforms, including public cloud providers and private infrastructure environments.

Before starting the setup, ensure that you have access to the target platform.

In this guide, you will walk through the following high-level steps:

1. **Prepare the infrastructure** based on the required [system prerequisites](/docs/studio/offerings/wme/getting-started/prerequisites).
2. **Install required prerequisite software** according to the operating system used in your environment.
3. **Obtain and install WaveMaker Enterprise**, using the installer or images (such as installer packages, VHD, or OVA files) provided by the WaveMaker team.
4. **Configure WaveMaker Enterprise** to align with your organization’s requirements.

Platform-specific instructions and configurations are covered in their respective setup guides.
