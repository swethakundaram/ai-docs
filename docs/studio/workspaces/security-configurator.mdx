    <p>
      00:00: In this video we are walking you through the Security Configuration
      Workspace. We will go through each and every security configuration in
      details and where and how it is done
    </p>
    <p>
      00:10: You will learn how to configure key security settings to ensure
      proper access control and system safeguards.
    </p>
    <p>
      00:17: To access the main security configuration workspace click on the
      settings icon in the left nav.
    </p>
    <p>
      00:23: Click the Security tab to open the security configuration options
      available in the workspace.
    </p>
    <p>
      00:28: There are two tabs here, General and Authentication and
      Authorisation.
    </p>
    <p>
      00:33: In general are present the configuration of SSL, Safeguards and
      Trust store.
    </p>
    <p>
      00:39: You can turn on Secure Socket layer(SSL) here and provide your port
      number to enable secure communications
    </p>
    <p>
      00:46: Now let's visit the Safeguard tab. Here you can configure XSS,
      X-frame, CORS, and Allowed Hosts, settings.
    </p>
    <p>
      00:55: XSS or Cross Site Scripting, is a web security vulnerability where
      an attacker manages to inject malicious JavaScript into a website, and
      that script runs in the victim's browser as if it were trusted site
    </p>
    <p>
      01:08: code. In XSS settings you will find three options, None, Encode,
      and Whitelist.
    </p>
    <p>
      01:14: You can choose based on your requirement and fill in the required
      details.
    </p>
    <p>
      01:19: When you select Encode strategy for XSS, you have this three
      options, Input, Output, or Both, in the Sanitisation layer.
    </p>
    <p>
      01:27: Encoding neutralises dangerous special characters into encoded
      string so that the browser treats them as HTML code, which otherwise could
      have been part of malicious scripting code.
    </p>
    <p>
      01:38: Whitelist validation is allowing only known good-input, and,
      rejecting everything else. When the strategy is selected as whitelist, you
      can choose the policy to be manual or imported. And then you have all the
      Tag rules options to choose from
    </p>
    <p>
      01:53: X-frame options tells the browser whether your web page is allowed
      to be embedded inside an iframe on another site.
    </p>
    <p>
      02:00: Its main purpose is to prevent clickjacking attacks. Let us explore
      the configuration options here.
    </p>
    <p>
      02:07: x frame configuration options are deny same Origin or allow from
    </p>
    <p>
      02:12: if you choose same origin only urls from only your domain will be
      allowed.
    </p>
    <p>
      02:18: And if you chose allow from it'll let you enter the domains that
      you want to allow from.
    </p>
    <p>
      02:24: Let's move on to the cross Origin resource sharing cause
      configuration.
    </p>
    <p>
      02:29: If we turn on allow credentials toggle, it allows user to include
      credentials like cookies and auth data to be sent with requests.
    </p>
    <p>02:37: We can also configure and set path entries.</p>
    <p>
      02:40: This takes comma separated domains and allows them. The default is
      to allow any hostname.
    </p>
    <p>
      02:46: Now, let's navigate to Trust store configurations, this is where we
      configure trusted certificates,
    </p>
    <p>02:53: used to validate server certificates for external API calls.</p>
    <p>
      02:57: The first thing to do here is set the type, 4 options, Disable,
      System Trust store, Custom Trust store, and Both.
    </p>
    <p>
      03:06: System trust store uses the default java trust store, the custom
      trust store uses the provided Custom trust store.
    </p>
    <p>03:14: and the fourth is both.</p>
    <p>
      03:17: When we select "system trust store", we need to choose the App
      Trust store file type. And based on what we select, we have to upload the
      respective file and provide the Trust store password.
    </p>
    <p>
      03:29: The file types allowed for upload are, JKS, PKCS-12, and JC-E-K-S.
    </p>
    <p>
      03:36: Mutual tls configuration is a setup where both sides of a
      connection or authenticate each other using tls certificates.
    </p>
    <p>
      03:44: The server validates client and the client validates the server, so
      let us see what we have in store here in mutual tls.
    </p>
    <p>
      03:52: So when mtl's is turned on we have a bunch of key store values
      configuration similar to trust store configuration.
    </p>
    <p>
      03:59: We first chose the key store file type and then upload the
      respective file and then provide the password.
    </p>
    <p>04:05: and here as well the file types are jk's pkcs12 and JC ek's</p>
    <p>
      04:12: Trust store hostname verification is a tls security. Check that
      ensures the server you connected to is actually the server you intended to
      connect to not just any server with a valid certificate so in this last
      section of trust store configuration TAB we enable or disable. Just that
    </p>
    <p>
      04:32: With this we have visited all the possible configuration of the
      general tab.
    </p>
    <p>
      04:37: Let us move to the next tab, that is, Authentication and
      authorisation.
    </p>
    <p>04:43: By default we see that Authentication is turned off.</p>
    <p>04:47: And a Warning message makes it abundantly clear.</p>
    <p>
      04:50: This also means that our application needs no sign in and anybody
      can just hit the url and use the application.
    </p>
    <p>04:57: Ok, let us enable authentication.</p>
    <p>
      05:00: As soon as we do that, we see a host of configuration settings open
      up. Let us go through them one by one.
    </p>
    <p>
      05:07: This enablement also means that any user who tried to access the
      application, needs to Authenticate himself with some sort of credentials
      like username and password.
    </p>
    <p>
      05:17: Among the settings that were exposed we see settings for
      Authentication and Authorisation.
    </p>
    <p>
      05:23: And there is a message that says, "No Security Providers Available.
      Click here to add".
    </p>
    <p>
      05:29: We can either use that Message or Click the blue plus button
      besides the Security providers tab.
    </p>
    <p>
      05:35: This action introduces the select dropdown that has the list of
      Security providers to choose from
    </p>
    <p>
      05:42: The options provided in the drop-down are demo database ldap active
      directory Cass Samuel open ID custom jw's and opaque.
    </p>
    <p>
      05:54: Let us select each of them one by one and explore the settings
      provided.
    </p>
    <p>
      05:59: The first option was demo and on selecting it. We can see that wave
      maker has created two dummy roles admin and user and has provided dummy
      credentials for the two users to authenticate themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      06:13: This demo provider is just to give a simulation of how
      authentication and authorization feels like.
    </p>
    <p>
      06:20: Let us chose database now. On choosing database as the security
      provider we see settings that asks for selecting the database that will
      provide Authentications,
    </p>
    <p>
      06:30: selecting the user table that holds the Authentication credentials
      for all users, then various columns for the user and the role mapping
    </p>
    <p>
      06:38: Now let us select LDAP. it asks for the LDAP server URL. Then it
      asks for Manager Distinguished name and password.
    </p>
    <p>
      06:47: And it also asks for various LDAP specific User fields and Role
      mapping fields, if enabled
    </p>
    <p>06:53: Next let us go to active directory as security provider.</p>
    <p>
      06:57: We see settings similar to ldap here. It asks for active directory
      domain and route distinguished.
    </p>
    <p>
      07:04: And in User and Role mapping sections we see Active directory
      specific fields.
    </p>
    <p>
      07:09: Now, let us move on to the next provider CAS. It stands for Central
      Authentication Service, which is a Single Sign-On protocol.
    </p>
    <p>
      07:17: As you can see, CAS comes with its own set of configuration fields,
      and we will go through each of them one by one.
    </p>
    <p>
      07:25: The first field is the Server URL, which represents the context
      path of the CAS server.
    </p>
    <p>07:32: Next is the Login URL.</p>
    <p>
      07:34: This is the login path relative to the server URL, and it specifies
      where the login page will be displayed.
    </p>
    <p>
      07:42: The third field is the Logout URL. This is the logout path relative
      to the server URL, and it defines where the logout action needs to be
      invoked.
    </p>
    <p>
      07:53: Following that is the Validation URL, which is the endpoint where
      service ticket validation takes place.
    </p>
    <p>08:00: The next field is the Service parameter name.</p>
    <p>
      08:03: This configures the request parameter that the system should look
      for when sending a request to CAS.
    </p>
    <p>
      08:09: Finally, the last configuration field in CAS is the Ticket
      parameter name.
    </p>
    <p>
      08:15: This configures the request parameter that is checked when
      attempting to determine whether a CAS ticket has been sent from the
      server.
    </p>
    <p>
      08:21: After all this configurations are put in place we can test it with
      the help of the proded Test Connection button.
    </p>
    <p>
      08:27: Next is the Role mapping which can be provided either by the CAS
      server or by a database table.
    </p>
    <p>08:34: Next we move on to sam'l.</p>
    <p>
      08:36: Sam'l is an xml-based open standard used for single sign-on, and it
      stands for security assertion markup language. Let us see what are its
      configuration settings.
    </p>
    <p>
      08:46: metadata URL this URL exposes the service providers sam'l metadata
      which the identity provider users to retrieve configuration details such
      as endpoints certificates and supported by bindings
    </p>
    <p>09:01: audience URL</p>
    <p>
      09:03: this URL uniquely identifies the service provider and is used by
      the identity provider to ensure that the sampler session is issued for the
      intended application.
    </p>
    <p>09:13: single sign-on URL</p>
    <p>
      09:16: this is the end point on the service provider where the identity
      provider sends the sound response after successful user authentication.
    </p>
    <p>09:25: single sign out URL</p>
    <p>
      09:28: this is the endpoint on the service provider that the identity
      provider calls to initiate logout and terminate the user's session across
      systems.
    </p>
    <p>
      09:38: Next section is the Identity provider settings. this is a toggle
      between the Identity provider metadata url or to upload the metadata file.
    </p>
    <p>
      09:47: Let us now visit the Login Configuration section. We can configure
      the app's login behavior by choosing Page or Dialog.
    </p>
    <p>
      09:55: Select Page to handle login on a dedicated page, where users are
      always redirected on app load.Select Dialog to prompt login through a
      dialog.
    </p>
    <p>10:04: The same configuration for the case when session times out.</p>
    <p>
      10:08: The next field is the session timeout, wher it takes a number in
      minutes.
    </p>
    <p>
      10:13: So the following field is Cookie Max age. This field also takes a
      number in minutes. A positive value is the time in minutes till when the
      cookie persists after browser closes. And a negative value means cookie is
      removed on browser close.
    </p>
    <p>10:28: The next field is for Maximum Concurrent Sessions, by a user.</p>
    <p>
      10:32: When the maximum session limit is reached, the least recently used
      session is expired.
    </p>
    <p>
      10:37: Setting the value to -1 makes it no limit for number of sessions,
      or to a positive integer to limit them.
    </p>
    <p>
      10:44: The next configuration section is Session persistence. The types
      allowed are in memory, and various database types and it's credentials
    </p>
    <p>
      10:53: The last tab under authentication is csrf or cross-site request
      forgery.
    </p>
    <p>
      11:00: Csrf is a security attack where a malicious website tricks are
      logged in users browser into sending an unauthorized request to a trusted
      website.
    </p>
    <p>11:09: here the form asks for token name</p>
    <p>11:12: first table we encounter an authorization is April's</p>
    <p>
      11:15: the UI provides means to add new app roles here and which pages
      they have access to
    </p>
    <p>
      11:21: and the roles that are already there in the service providers are
      listed here based on the roles. We can also configure the respective
      landing page.
    </p>
    <p>
      11:30: In Authorisation the second tab is Pages. This is a list of all the
      pages in the application.
    </p>
    <p>11:36: and against each of them is the configurable access level.</p>
    <p>
      11:41: For example, for the dashboard page, access can be given to either
      everyone or to only authenticated user.
    </p>
    <p>11:48: If Authenticated then we can do multi choosing of user roles.</p>
    <p>
      11:52: The services tab under Authorisation list all the service providers
      along with the services, in this case mostly REST endpoints.
    </p>
    <p>
      12:01: Each of this end points' access level can be configured just like
      pages Access level that we just saw.
    </p>
    <p>12:08: Last but not the least is the Prefab tab.</p>
    <p>
      12:11: This tab Lists all prefabs used in an application. And here also we
      can configure the Access level of each prefab based on the user role if
      Authenticated.
    </p>
    <p>
      12:22: With this, we conclude this walkthrough video. We hope you are now
      familiar with the Security Configuration Workspace and can confidently
      configure application security based on your app's specific security
      requirements.
