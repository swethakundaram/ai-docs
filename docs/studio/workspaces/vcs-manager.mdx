# VCS Manager

The VCS Manager in WaveMaker helps you manage and track your application's source code as it evolves. It brings essential version control workflows into a single, easy-to-navigate workspace.

- Manage your application's source code and track changes over time from one place

- Perform core version control actions like pull, push, view changes, and review commit history

- Collaborate smoothly by comparing versions, resolving conflicts, and syncing with external repositories

Watch the VCS Manager Walkthrough video below to explore the UI and understand how these workflows come together in WaveMaker.

    <p>
      00:00: Hi, and welcome!. In this video, we'll take a guided walk through
      of the VCS Manage in
    </p>
    <p>
      00:06: WaveMaker. Along the way, you'll see how this space helps you
      manage and maintain your code repository—bringing together contributions
      from multiple developers working in parallel, while keeping versions clean
      and manageable.
    </p>
    <p>00:18: Let's get started.</p>
    <p>00:20: For this video, we have set up a project.</p>
    <p>
      00:23: We have a single page called dashboard. And an imported database.
    </p>
    <p>
      00:28: So, this actions have created code, which are organised in the
      project structure as folders and files.
    </p>
    <p>
      00:34: This will help us set up the context and view the source code and
      it's evolution.
    </p>
    <p>00:40: So, let's get to the VCS workspace as shown here.</p>
    <p>
      00:43: In the VCS dropdown we see five options, which are behind the
      scene, mostly, VCS commands, which we are fairly familiar with. Pull,
      Push, View changes, and commit history.
    </p>
    <p>
      00:56: The 5th option is for configuration of your project with an
      external repo, that you might own.
    </p>
    <p>
      01:02: This makes it possible to push code directly to your own external
      repo.
    </p>
    <p>
      01:07: When we go to the pool changes menu wave maker Checks if there are
      any uncommitted local changes.
    </p>
    <p>
      01:13: If so it temporarily stashes them pulls the latest changes from the
      remote master into the local repository and then reapply the stashed
      changes.
    </p>
    <p>01:23: Once the pull is completed successfully the project reloads.</p>
    <p>01:27: There can be merge conflicts during a pool more on that later.</p>
    <p>01:32: Let us go to the next menu item, "Push Changes".</p>
    <p>01:35: This invokes the push changes dialogue.</p>
    <p>
      01:38: We see the project name and a text area to type in our commit
      message below the text area is an uneditable text box that adequately
      lists down all uncommitted changes.
    </p>
    <p>01:50: Let us enter our commit message describing the changes.</p>
    <p>
      01:53: Make sure the description is comprehensive enough for other
      contributors
    </p>
    <p>
      01:57: Click on "Ok" to confirm and save your commit message for the push
      operation.
    </p>
    <p>
      02:02: Clicking on the view changes would open up the dialogue where we
      can view all our uncommited changes.
    </p>
    <p>
      02:08: But, since we just now pushed our changes, the local repository is
      clean and the dialogue won't show up in this case.
    </p>
    <p>
      02:15: We will visit that dialogue later, after we make some local changes
    </p>
    <p>02:20: Let us now, visit the next menu item, "Commit History".</p>
    <p>02:24: This is the commit history dialogue.</p>
    <p>
      02:26: All the commits made by various contributors are listed here with
      the latest on the top.
    </p>
    <p>02:31: In this case the sole contributor is me.</p>
    <p>02:35: So the author column shows only one name.</p>
    <p>
      02:38: letters visit the first commit by clicking on the view changes link
      of the last item in the row
    </p>
    <p>02:45: As soon as we create a project in wavemaker.</p>
    <p>02:48: It creates a host of files behind the scene.</p>
    <p>
      02:51: These files are project configuration files UI related front-end
      files service-related back-end files, etc. All these files get committed
      and pushed on the very first creation of The Project
    </p>
    <p>
      03:03: As we go further, we will be making changes to pages such as modify
      Pages create Pages etc.
    </p>
    <p>
      03:11: So we are specifically interested in the pages section within all
      the committed files.
    </p>
    <p>
      03:16: So let us go through all the files, which were created by default
      within the pages section of the commit.
    </p>
    <p>
      03:24: Here you can see the files related to a page of type partial in a
      folder called common like common dot CSS and so on.
    </p>
    <p>03:32: Here we can see all the files related to the Login page.</p>
    <p>
      03:37: On the creation of a project in wavemaker. It Creates a page by
      default, called the main page. And here you can see all the files, related
      to the main page in the main folder.
    </p>
    <p>03:49: Other pages created are, footer, header, Etc.</p>
    <p>
      03:54: Now let us go visit the commit history space where files have been
      added or modified and committed.
    </p>
    <p>
      04:00: What we are trying to do here is observe how the VCS were spaces UI
      presents the differences between the two versions of the same file before
      and after the commit.
    </p>
    <p>
      04:12: Here, we see the commit history list. The most recent at the top.
    </p>
    <p>
      04:17: On the rightmost side of each row is a call to action called "View
      Changes".
    </p>
    <p>
      04:22: Let us go to the latest commit and view the interface of how the
      changes are presented.
    </p>
    <p>
      04:28: At the very top we see the commit ID followed by the timestamp and
      author.
    </p>
    <p>
      04:33: And then there is a listed table of all files, either modified
      added or deleted if present.
    </p>
    <p>
      04:40: On the right end of each row is a icon button that will take us to
      the actual changes of that particular file. Let's view one.
    </p>
    <p>04:47: I am selecting the employee dot HTML file.</p>
    <p>
      04:50: This is a newly added file and hence the previous server version
      shows blank and the content of the committed version is shown on the
      right.
    </p>
    <p>
      05:11: Let's see what the difference shows in the committed version in
      line 29 a new object called Go to page. Employee got inserted and this
      means a new page navigation variable for the newly created employee page.
      Got added.
    </p>
    <p>05:24: this is a 10 line insertion</p>
    <p>
      05:30: No let us go checkout some files that have changes to existing
      lines of code. For that, I would like to select the second commit from
      top, which has the commit message, Modified left nav and header.
    </p>
    <p>
      05:41: As you can see, there are two files here that were modified in this
      commit.
    </p>
    <p>05:45: header dot HTML and left nav dot HTML</p>
    <p>05:49: let us first checkout the header.HTML file.</p>
    <p>
      05:54: In the server version of the file we see some red highlighting.
    </p>
    <p>
      05:57: For example in line 7 the value top right is highlighted in red and
      correspondingly in the committed version of the file. We see it has been
      replaced by the value start and this has been highlighted as Green
    </p>
    <p>
      06:11: now red highlighting means an omission and green highlighting means
      an addition.
    </p>
    <p>
      06:18: Similarly, let's go visit the changes of the left nav dot HTML
      file.
    </p>
    <p>
      06:24: We see the same pattern of suggesting red highlighting as a
      mission.
    </p>
    <p>
      06:28: Here we see the entire lines of code from the second to sixth liner
      emitted.
    </p>
    <p>06:33: Let us revisit the pull menu.</p>
    <p>
      06:39: If you recall we have encountered this prompt before so I am
      clicking okay to pull changes from remote.
    </p>
    <p>
      06:46: So my changes were stashed and changes were pulled from remote and
      now it will try and apply my changes on top.
    </p>
    <p>06:54: If you recall I created a page called employee.</p>
    <p>
      06:59: another team's member made changes to that Pages page title and
      committed
    </p>
    <p>
      07:03: I too have made changes to the page title so you can see here. We
      have encountered emerge conflict.
    </p>
    <p>07:10: Now let us see how it can be resolved.</p>
    <p>
      07:12: What we see here, are three options, "Apply Local", meaning discard
      changes from Remote and override with my local changes.
    </p>
    <p>
      07:21: The 2nd option is "Apply Remote", meaning override local changes
      with changes from remote.
    </p>
    <p>
      07:27: The third and last option is "Resolve conflict" which means,
      manually edit the merged file and apply.
    </p>
    <p>07:34: let us go through the rest of this UI</p>
    <p>07:36: on the left menu we see two grouping filters category named as</p>
    <p>07:42: all others and pages</p>
    <p>
      07:45: Since we have only one file that has conflict we see the count of
      all and pages as one.
    </p>
    <p>
      07:51: The next grouping is change type and we see there are a total of 6
      files with changes.
    </p>
    <p>07:58: count of files with changes from both local and remote is one</p>
    <p>
      08:02: total files with changes in the local R3 and remote files with
      changes are 4 the main content area has two tabs review merge that gives a
      list of files with conflicts.
    </p>
    <p>
      08:15: The other TAB called resolve conflict opens up the files with
      conflict in the diff format one by one.
    </p>
    <p>
      08:22: Here I am chosen to go with the resolve conflict button on the
      rightmost side of each files row. This gives me control to review and
      resolve conflict manually by editing the merged file.
    </p>
    <p>
      08:34: So, I am hitting the edit button here, to go and manually edit the
      file.
    </p>
    <p>
      08:38: We are presented with the three, split windows UI. On the left is
      the Remote server file. On the right is the local file, and in the middle
      is the merged file. The place where the conflict exists, is highlighted
      red.
    </p>
    <p>08:52: Let us see the situation here.</p>
    <p>
      08:54: The caption attribute on line number 6 is where the conflict
      resides. The remote file has the value, Employee Listing, And the local
      file has the value as, Employee List.
    </p>
    <p>09:07: And I want the value to be, Employee List, like the local.</p>
    <p>
      09:11: I can do this in three ways, discard remote, or take local, or
      manually edit the merged file and make the value as, Employee List.
    </p>
    <p>
      09:21: So I go to the merge result window and Manually edit the caption
      value as Employee List
    </p>
    <p>
      09:32: Since this was the only conflict, I am going ahead and hitting on
      the apply button here.
    </p>
    <p>
      09:36: So we are left with no files that has conflicts. and this prompt
      asks me to reload the project.
    </p>
    <p>
      09:43: We must take note here, that files which had no conflicts are
      pulled in, if from remote, and applied if from local.
    </p>
    <p>
      09:50: So we see that, as expected both the tabs are devoid of any files
      with conflict.
    </p>
    <p>
      10:04: let us go to the filter called, All, to see all the changed files
      list. and we can see here that only one file had conflicts and it is green
      now, which means it has been resolved
    </p>
    <p>
      10:16: we can go and view how we resolved it by clicking on this edit
      button here.
    </p>
    <p>
      10:22: So since, everything looks good here. I want to finish the merge
      and move on. Hitting ok for this prompt here.
    </p>
    <p>10:29: And the project reloads.</p>
    <p>
      10:34: There is one more menu, we said, we will revisit, once we have
      local changes. And that is, View Changes.
    </p>
    <p>10:42: So let's see,</p>
    <p>10:43: how does the view changes UI looks like.</p>
    <p>
      10:46: So this dialogue structurally lists down all the files which are
      changed locally.
    </p>
    <p>10:50: There are two folders and one file in the root directory</p>
    <p>
      10:54: So in the List of files, we can visit any files, and compare to the
      files in the remote.
    </p>
    <p>11:10: And that's about it with the View changes menu.</p>
    <p>11:14: Let's visit the last Menu, that is, Push to External Repo.</p>
    <p>
      11:17: we are presented with this simple UI where wavemaker provides us
      the settings to set up our project with an external Repo
    </p>
    <p>
      11:25: this enables us to pull and push code directly to an external
      repository that we might own.
    </p>
    <p>11:31: The first option is github.</p>
    <p>
      11:33: This is a form with four Fields we need to provide the data for the
      respective github account and hit export.
    </p>
    <p>11:39: This will set up the project directly with the github account.</p>
    <p>
      11:43: The same goes with Bit bucket. If you own a Bitbucket account, you
      can set up this project directly with your Bitbucket account
    </p>
    <p>11:50: If you have a Git Repo account, set it up here.</p>
    <p>
      11:56: So that was all, you need to know to set up your WaveMaker project
      to your External repo.
    </p>
    <p>
      12:01: I hope this walkthrough adequately equipped you with the knowledge
      of the VCS manager of wavemaker. You have learned how to pull and push
      code how to view your changes and compared against files on the remote how
      to resolve conflict if required
    </p>
    <p>
      12:16: and most of all how to work collaboratively with fellow teammates
      on the same project.
