# Development Model
WaveMaker provides a technology agnostic UI development methodology without requiring app developers to learn the underlying javascript frameworks i.e., Angular, React or React Native. Both web and mobile app developers embrace a unified development model with the same UI concepts for building apps.

## Hybrid development approach
Developers are provided with a hybrid approach for building apps
#### 1. Visually using Studio 
- Drag-n-drop canvas makes it easy to create layouts, components and their properties discoverable without requiring developers to go through a lot of documentation.
- Properties panel for each component and UI element enhances learnability and Studio automatically generates the corresponding page markup i.e. WML with the right syntax.
- Different workspaces are available for building Pages, importing REST APIs, working with Databases & creating microservices for backend
#### 2. Using prompts through AI Agents
- Swith to agentic mode to instruct the underlying AI model to generate pages, components and javascript code with simple natural language prompts
- Agents are available for specific functionality such as design to code conversion, binding to REST APIs, configuring accessibility, language support etc. 
#### 3. Editing and Authoring code in editor.
- App artifacts in WaveMaker are developer-friendly and provides complete control to developers to edit manually within Studio.
- Generated Angular or React code can be exported and is readable, modifiable and maintainable outside Studio environment. But, any modifications made outside cannot be brought back into Studio.
