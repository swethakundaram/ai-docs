# Layout Container Components

A container defines the structural arrangement of content on a page. It acts as the foundation for building any user interface by controlling where and how components are placed on the screen. To structure a page in the UI or position components in the desired locations, containers play a crucial role. Without containers, managing alignment, spacing, and responsiveness becomes difficult, especially as the page grows in complexity.

In WaveMaker, a wide range of container components is available to help organize page content efficiently. These containers group ui components into meaningful sections, ensuring consistency, responsiveness, and ease of maintenance across the application. 

By using containers, you can build consistent UI patterns across pages and applications, while also creating responsive designs with minimal effort.
WaveMaker supports multiple container options to address different design needs, such as:
- Container
- Accordion
- Panel
- Tabs
- Tile
- Wizard

Each container is designed to simplify UI development and improve the overall user experience.
