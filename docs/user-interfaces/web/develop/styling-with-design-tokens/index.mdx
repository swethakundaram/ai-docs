# Styling Architecture 

In a [Design System project](../../../../design-system/design-system-project), styling in WaveMaker follows a structured, token-driven architecture.

The system ensures consistency, controlled customization, and safe extensibility.

---

## Styling Flow Overview


---

## 1. Design Token Mapping

This layer connects external or predefined design tokens to WaveMaker's internal styling system.

It ensures:

- Tokens are recognized by the platform
- Naming conventions are aligned
- Tokens can be consumed through CSS variables
- Styling remains system-driven, not hard-coded

This is the entry point of styling into the application runtime.

---

## 2. Foundation CSS

Foundation CSS is the core styling engine of the project.

It is built entirely on **CSS variables** and defines:

- Color system
- Typography scale
- Spacing system
- Border radius
- Elevation and shadows
- Surface and background layers

All component styles resolve through these variables.

This enables:

- Runtime theming
- Centralized visual control
- Scalable styling across the entire application

---

## 3. WaveMaker Components

WaveMaker components are designed to:

- Consume Foundation CSS variables
- Avoid hard-coded styling values
- Support system-based variants
- Maintain consistent visual behavior

Components inherit their look and feel from the token layer.

This ensures:

- Uniform UI across screens
- Predictable styling behavior
- Easy global updates through token changes

---

## 4. Style Workspace

Style Workspace is the management layer for styling customization.

It allows developers to:

- Modify token values
- Create component variants
- Extend design definitions safely
- Preview changes in real-time

All customizations are structured and system-aware.

No direct CSS fragmentation.

---

## 5. Generated Overrides

When tokens or component variants are modified:

- Overridden tokens are tracked
- Structured override files are generated (`override.css`)
- Base Foundation CSS remains untouched

This ensures:

- Upgrade safety
- Clear separation between system and customization
- Controlled extensibility

---

## Runtime Behavior

At runtime:

- Foundation CSS injects token values as CSS variables
- Components resolve styles using those variables
- Overrides apply only where defined
- The final WM application renders consistently

The system separates structure from styling, enabling applications to scale without visual inconsistency.

---

## Summary

Styling in a Design System project is:

- Token-driven
- CSS variable based
- Component-governed
- Workspace-managed
- Override-controlled

This architecture ensures scalable, maintainable, and enterprise-ready UI development in WaveMaker.
