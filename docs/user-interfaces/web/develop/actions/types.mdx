## Navigation Action
The Navigation Action in WaveMaker provides built in navigation capabilities that enable movement between pages or views within an application. Navigation actions define how and when page transitions occur in response to events.

#### Properties

| Property | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| Navigation Target | Sets Navigation Target (Previous Page, Page, Tab or Accordion)|
| Page Name | The page name to navigate to |

```javascript
// Example 1: Navigate to TestPage
Page.Actions.goToPage_TestPage.invoke();

// Example 2: Navigate to TestPage with url params
Page.Actions.goToPage_TestPage.invoke({
     data: {
         'param1': "param value",
         "param2": "param value 2"
     }
});

// Example 3: Navigate to TestPage by setting the input fields
Var nv = Page.Actions.goToPage_TestPage;
nv.setData({
   'param1': "param value",
   "param2": "param value 2"
});
nv.invoke();
```

## Login Action
The Login Action in WaveMaker provides a standardized mechanism for user authentication. Automatically created when security is enabled, it integrates with the configured security provider and supports flexible customization through properties and events. By leveraging the Login Action, applications can implement secure, role-based access with minimal configuration.

The Login Action exposes standard action lifecycle events, These events can be used to implement custom authentication logic, error handling, or navigation behavior.:
- onSuccess
- onError
- onBeforeInvoke

#### Properties

| Property | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| Use default success handler | If checked, on successful login, the logged in user will be redirected to the Landing Page configured against the user role (refer to Login Configuration under Security for more info). If a custom logic is required, uncheck this property and implement the logic under the onSuccess event of the Action.|
| Update data on input change | If checked, the component will be triggered automatically on the change of input data (as mentioned in the data tab) for the Action. |
| Request data on page load | If checked, 'Page' scoped will be triggered on page load while 'Application' scoped will be triggered on application load. |
| In Flight Behavior | This property determines the behavior when a call is fired through the action with the previous call still pending. Action queues all these calls, waits for the previous call completion and then based on the value of the inFlightBehavior property, decides what to do with all the queued calls: - doNotExecute - all the queued calls will be discarded, - executeAll - all the calls will be triggered one by one, or - executeLast - only the last call is triggered and the rest are discarded, this is the default behavior |
| Spinner Context | This property specifies on which UI widget the spinner should show. Leave empty if no spinner required. |
| Spinner Message | The message to be displayed below the spinner. Leave empty if no message is required below the spinner. Note: If multiple actions are fired then the spinner messages will be displayed as a list below a single spinner. |

## Logout Action
A Logout Action is automatically created when you implement Security in your application. You can edit the Properties and Events of the Logout Action from the Actions dialog.

---
## Timer Action
Timer action can be used to trigger events repeatedly at timed intervals.

---
## Notification Action
Notification Action is an action to show UI notifications in the app in the form of a toaster, alert or a confirmation box. It provides message capabilities, a way for the app to notify the end users. Based on the operation selected app can notify the user through an Alert/Confirm dialog or a simple toaster message. This action can be useful in cases like error handling, confirm user action, etc.
