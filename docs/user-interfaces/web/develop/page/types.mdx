# Types of pages

There are two types of pages that can be created in an application:

- Page 
- Partial

### Page 
Which can be loaded independently in the application. These act as a route within the application when associated with navigation events.

### Partial
These are associated with a component within a page. Common sections of a page such as headers or left navigation are typically built as reusable partials. This allows the same component to be used consistently across multiple pages in the application.
- **Header:** The header appears at the top of the page and usually contains key elements like the page title, logo, or important actions.
- **Top Nav:** The top navigation sits below or within the header and is used to move between major sections of the application. It gives users a clear, consistent way to navigate high-level pages without losing context.
- **Left Panel:** The left panel typically contains menus, links, or navigation options related to the main content. It’s often used for section-based navigation and helps users quickly switch between related views or features.
- **Right Panel:** The right panel is usually used for secondary content such as filters, additional details, settings, or contextual actions. It supports the main content without taking focus away from it.
- **Footer:** The footer appears at the bottom of the page and is used for supplementary information like links, legal text, version details, or secondary actions. It provides helpful information without cluttering the main page area.

**Popover** - Popover, also known as pop-up, can be built as a portion of a page, reusable and contains UI elements with data binding (e.g.: drill down details, pop-up menus etc.). These can be built like a partial page, but have pop-up based interaction.
