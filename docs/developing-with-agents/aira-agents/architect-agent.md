The **Architect Agent** is a guidance-focused agent that helps developers make **architectural decisions** when building applications on WaveMaker. Its role is to provide clarity on design approaches, platform constraints, and recommended patterns before any implementation work begins.

The Architect Agent does not create code, configure projects, or execute tasks. It exists to help you understand *how something should be designed* so that development starts with the right direction.

## What the Architect Agent Is Used For

The Architect Agent is designed to support early-stage thinking and decision-making. Developers typically use it when they want to validate an approach, understand how different parts of a system should fit together, or confirm that a design aligns with WaveMaker’s capabilities.

It is especially useful for questions involving structure, integration, or cross-domain design, such as how UI, backend services, data, and security should interact in a WaveMaker application. The agent focuses on reasoning and explanation rather than implementation.

## When to Use the Architect Agent

Use the Architect Agent when you are planning a feature, workflow, or integration and want architectural clarity before building. It is helpful when you are unsure about platform constraints, recommended design patterns, or the trade-offs between different approaches.

If your requirement is already clear and you want backend or UI changes to be created automatically, this agent is not the right choice. In those cases, execution-focused agents should be used instead.

## How the Architect Agent Helps

When you ask a question, the Architect Agent analyzes it in the context of WaveMaker’s documented behavior and known architectural patterns. It explains relevant concepts, highlights constraints, and outlines possible approaches along with their trade-offs.

For scenarios that span multiple areas—such as UI, APIs, data access, or security—the agent helps clarify boundaries and dependencies so that the overall design remains consistent. Its guidance helps reduce rework by identifying architectural issues early.


## What You’ll Get Back

The Architect Agent responds with explanations and recommendations that support decision-making. These responses are descriptive and advisory, not step-by-step instructions or code.

The goal of each response is to help you confidently decide **what should be built and how it should be structured**, before implementation begins.


## What the Architect Agent Does Not Do

To set clear expectations, the Architect Agent does not:

* Write or modify code
* Configure applications or services
* Execute tasks or workflows
* Replace agents that build or change applications

It is an architectural advisor, not a builder.


## How It Fits into a Development Workflow

The Architect Agent is most effective when used early in the development process. By clarifying design decisions upfront, it makes later implementation smoother and more predictable. Once architectural direction is clear, execution can be handed off to other agents or development tools with confidence.

## Summary

The Architect Agent exists to answer one core question:

**“How should this be designed in WaveMaker?”**

If you are looking for architectural clarity before building, this is the agent to use.
