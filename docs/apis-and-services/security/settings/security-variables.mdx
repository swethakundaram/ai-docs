# Security Variables 

WaveMaker automatically creates a **[Variable](../../../user-interfaces/web/develop/integrating-with-apis/variables)** and **two actions** whenever authentication is enabled. These integrate with the default **login page** and **logout button** in the top navigation. Even if you design a custom login page, these variables and actions can be bound to handle authentication seamlessly.

This page provides a unified overview for quick reference.

## 1. `loggedInUser`

- **Purpose:** Holds the details of the currently authenticated user.  
- **Contents:** Populated based on the user profile fields defined in your security provider.  
- **Usage:** Can be used to display user information, control page access, or drive conditional UI elements.

## 2. `loginAction`

- **Purpose:** Handles the login process by capturing user input and performing authentication.  
- **Parameters:**
  - `username` – the user’s login ID
  - `password` – the user’s password
  - `rememberMe` – optional, retains session details across visits

- **Key Properties:**
  - `useDefaultSuccessHandler`:  
    Determines whether the default post-login behavior (e.g., landing page selection) is applied.  
    :::note
    To override the default behavior, uncheck `useDefaultSuccessHandler` and implement a custom **onSuccess** event.
    :::

- **Remember Me:**  
  - Retains the session in a persistent cookie.
  - Default validity: **15 days** or until the user signs out, whichever occurs first.  
  :::note
  During testing, restarting the application creates a new session, so the cookie will not persist.
  :::

- **Functionality:**  
  - Validates `username` and `password` against the configured security provider.
  - Establishes a secure session for the authenticated user.

For more details, see [Remember Me](#).

## 3. `logoutAction`

- **Purpose:** Handles user sign-out from the application.  
- **Redirect To:**  
  Specifies the page to navigate to after logout. By default, this is set to the login page but can be customized to any application page.  
- **Functionality:**  
  - Clears the session.
  - Ensures the user is no longer authenticated.

---

## Summary

- These variables and actions are **server-side enforced**, ensuring secure authentication and authorization.  
- They can be used with **components** or **custom login/logout pages**.  
- Together with features like **Remember Me** and **Concurrent Sessions**, they allow you to create secure, scalable, and user-friendly authentication flows.
