# Remember Me

The **Remember Me** feature allows an application to retain a user’s authenticated session by storing session details in a persistent cookie.  
By default, this cookie remains valid for **15 days** or until the user explicitly signs out of the application—whichever occurs first.

---

## How It Works

When a user logs in with the **“Remember Me”** option selected on the login page, the application creates and stores a *remember-me* cookie in the user’s browser.

On subsequent visits:
- If a valid remember-me cookie is present,
- The application automatically authenticates the user,
- And grants access **without requiring credentials to be entered again**.

In essence, Remember Me enables **automatic login** by including a remember-me cookie in the request headers.

## Remember Me in WaveMaker Applications

- The Remember Me feature is **enabled by default** when security is turned on in a WaveMaker application.
- During login, the authentication request includes the `j_rememberme` parameter with a value of `true` or `on` when the user selects the Remember Me option.
- After successful authentication:
  - WaveMaker issues a cookie named `remember-me`
  - The cookie value uniquely identifies the authenticated user for future requests.
- On subsequent requests, the application validates:
  - The username associated with the cookie
  - The cookie’s expiry time

Only valid cookies allow automatic login.

## Remember Me Configuration

The following Remember Me settings can be configured per application.

### Enable or Disable Remember Me

Remember Me is enabled by default.  
It can be disabled or enabled by updating:
- `auth-info.json`
- Environment-specific **profile property files**


### Expiry Interval

The default lifetime of the remember-me cookie is **15 days** from the time of creation.  
This duration can be modified by updating:
- `auth-info.json`
- Environment-specific **profile property files**
