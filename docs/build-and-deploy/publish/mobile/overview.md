# Mobile Publishing Overview

Mobile publishing distributes WaveMaker React Native applications to end users through app stores, enterprise channels, or testing platforms. This involves taking signed application packages (APK, AAB, IPA) built from your WaveMaker project and submitting them to distribution channels where users can install them.

Publishing is distinct from building. **Building** generates signed packages from your WaveMaker project using AppChef, wm-reactnative-cli, or Expo EAS Build. **Publishing** takes those built packages and submits them to Google Play Store, Apple App Store, enterprise distribution systems, or testing platforms.

---

## WaveMaker Publishing Workflow

WaveMaker mobile app publishing follows a structured workflow from Studio to distribution.

**1. Build signed packages**

Build your WaveMaker React Native app using one of these methods:

- **[AppChef](../../build/mobile/appchef)** – Export React Native zip from WaveMaker Studio, upload to AppChef, configure certificates and build type, download signed APK/AAB/IPA
- **[wm-reactnative-cli](../../build/mobile/cli)** – Export project from Studio, build locally using CLI with certificates, generate signed packages
- **[Expo EAS Build](../../build/mobile/expo)** – Export project as Expo-compatible, use Expo EAS Build service for cloud builds

**2. Download build artifacts**

After successful build in AppChef or build tool, download the signed packages:

- **Android**: APK (for direct install/testing) or AAB (required for Play Store production)
- **iOS**: IPA file signed with distribution certificate and provisioning profile

AppChef provides QR codes for quick installation on test devices without uploading to stores.

**3. Submit to distribution channels**

Upload downloaded packages to your chosen distribution channel:

- **[Google Play Console](https://play.google.com/console)** – Upload AAB to production track or testing tracks
- **[Apple App Store Connect](https://appstoreconnect.apple.com/)** – Upload IPA via Transporter app or Xcode
- **Testing platforms** – [TestFlight](https://developer.apple.com/testflight/) (iOS), Play testing tracks (Android), [Firebase App Distribution](https://firebase.google.com/docs/app-distribution)
- **Enterprise** – MDM systems, private app stores, direct distribution via QR codes or links

**4. Monitor and update**

After release, monitor crash reports, user feedback, and ratings. Publish updates by rebuilding in AppChef with incremented version numbers and uploading to stores following the same workflow.

---

## Distribution Channels

WaveMaker React Native apps can be distributed through multiple channels depending on target audience and use case.

**[Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/console)** – Primary public distribution for Android. Requires [Google Play Console](https://play.google.com/console) account ($25 one-time), signed AAB file (generated by [AppChef](../../build/mobile/appchef) with production certificate), and compliance with Play Store policies. Supports staged rollouts, multiple testing tracks (Internal, Closed, Open, Production), and global reach to billions of Android devices.

**[Apple App Store](https://appstoreconnect.apple.com/)** – Primary public distribution for iOS. Requires [Apple Developer Program](https://developer.apple.com/programs/) membership ($99/year), signed IPA file (generated by [AppChef](../../build/mobile/appchef) with distribution certificate and provisioning profile), and compliance with [App Store Review Guidelines](https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/). Includes [TestFlight](https://developer.apple.com/testflight/) for beta testing and supports phased releases over 7 days.

**Enterprise Distribution** – Internal company distribution without public app stores. iOS requires [Apple Developer Enterprise Program](https://developer.apple.com/programs/enterprise/) ($299/year) with enterprise certificates uploaded to [AppChef](../../build/mobile/appchef). Android supports [Managed Google Play](https://support.google.com/googleplay/work/answer/6145139), MDM systems, or direct APK distribution via [AppChef QR codes](../../build/mobile/appchef#qr-code-installation-android). Used for proprietary business apps and internal tools.

**Testing Channels** – Beta and UAT distribution before public release. Includes [TestFlight](https://developer.apple.com/testflight/) (iOS with IPA from AppChef), Play Console testing tracks (Android with APK/AAB from AppChef), [Firebase App Distribution](https://firebase.google.com/docs/app-distribution) (upload APK/IPA from AppChef), and direct installation via [AppChef-generated QR codes](../../build/mobile/appchef#qr-code-installation-android) for rapid internal testing.

---

## Publishing Workflow

The publishing workflow follows a consistent pattern across platforms using WaveMaker tools.

**1. Build application package in WaveMaker**

- Open your React Native project in WaveMaker Studio
- Export React Native zip from Build menu → Manual Build or Open AppChef
- Upload React Native zip to AppChef
- Configure build type (Development or Production)
- Select or upload certificates (iOS: P12 + provisioning profile, Android: keystore)
- Unlock certificates by providing passwords (valid for 24 hours)
- Trigger build and wait for completion
- Download signed APK/AAB (Android) or IPA (iOS) from AppChef
- Alternative: Use wm-reactnative-cli to build locally or export to Expo and use EAS Build

**2. Set up developer account**

- Register with Google Play Console ($25 one-time) or Apple Developer Program ($99/year)
- Complete account verification and payment
- Accept platform agreements and policies

**3. Create app listing**

- **Android:** Navigate to Play Console, create new app, provide app details
- **iOS:** Navigate to App Store Connect, create new app record with bundle ID
- Define app name (must match build configuration bundle identifier)
- Upload store assets (screenshots, feature graphics, icons)
- Configure pricing, availability, and distribution countries
- Complete content rating and data safety declarations

**4. Upload application package**

- **Android:** Navigate to Play Console → Production or Testing track → Create release → Upload AAB downloaded from AppChef
- **iOS:** Use Transporter app or Xcode Organizer to upload IPA downloaded from AppChef to App Store Connect
- Configure release notes and version information
- Set rollout strategy (immediate, scheduled, or phased/staged)

**5. Submit for review** (if required)

- **Android:** Automated checks and minimal manual review for most apps (hours to days typical)
- **iOS:** Full manual human review for all submissions (24-48 hours typical)
- Monitor review status in console
- Address any review feedback, policy violations, or rejection reasons

**6. Release to users**

- Upon approval, release according to chosen strategy
- **Immediate:** App goes live instantly after approval
- **Scheduled:** Trigger release at specific date/time
- **Phased/Staged:** Gradual rollout (Android: custom percentages, iOS: 7-day automatic rollout)
- Monitor post-release metrics, crash reports, and user feedback

## Platform Differences

iOS and Android publishing processes differ significantly due to platform philosophies and policies.

| Aspect           | Android (Play Store)       | iOS (App Store)        |
| ---------------- | -------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| Account cost     | $25 one-time               | $99/year               |
| Package format   | APK or AAB (AAB required)  | IPA                    |
| Review process   | Automated + minimal manual | Full manual review     |
| Approval time    | Hours to days              | 24-48 hours typical    |
| Update process   | Faster, less restrictive   | All updates reviewed   |
| Content policies | More permissive            | Stricter guidelines    |
| Testing platform | Play Console tracks        | TestFlight             |
| Beta testers     | Unlimited (internal: 100)  | 10,000 (internal: 100) |
| Rejection rate   | Lower                      | Higher                 |

**Android publishing characteristics:**

- More automated review process with policy checks
- Faster approval for most apps (hours to days)
- Flexible update policies, faster iteration
- Multiple testing tracks built-in (Internal, Closed, Open, Production)
- App signing can be delegated to Google (Play App Signing recommended)
- AAB format required for Play Store (AppChef generates AAB for production builds automatically)
- APK available from AppChef for direct testing via QR codes

**iOS publishing characteristics:**

- Manual human review required for all submissions and updates
- Stricter content and functionality guidelines (App Store Review Guidelines)
- All updates go through full review process (even bug fixes)
- TestFlight tightly integrated for beta testing (upload IPA from AppChef)
- Phased releases available (automatic 7-day rollout: 1% → 2% → 5% → 10% → 20% → 50% → 100%)
- IPA must be signed with distribution certificate and provisioning profile uploaded to AppChef
- Cannot promote TestFlight builds to production (must upload new IPA)

## Distribution Strategy Considerations

Choosing the right distribution channel depends on application purpose, target audience, and organizational requirements.

**Choose public app stores when:**

- Targeting general consumers or broad user base
- Maximizing discoverability and reach through store search and browsing
- Monetization through app stores required (in-app purchases, paid apps)
- Leveraging platform credibility and trust signals
- Standard consumer app use case with App Store/Play Store distribution infrastructure

**Choose enterprise distribution when:**

- Internal company use only (employees or authorized partners)
- Proprietary business logic, trade secrets, or sensitive business data
- Faster deployment cycles needed without multi-day app store review delays
- App violates public store policies but serves legitimate enterprise purpose
- Distribution limited to specific organizations via MDM or private stores

**Use testing channels for:**

- Pre-release validation and QA testing before public launch
- Beta testing with select users to gather feedback
- Identifying bugs and crashes in real-world usage
- Internal UAT and stakeholder review cycles
- Iterative testing without store submission overhead
- Quick distribution via AppChef QR codes for internal testing (scan and install directly)

---

## Updates and Version Management

Publishing is not one-time—WaveMaker mobile applications require ongoing updates for features, bug fixes, and platform compatibility.

**Version semantics:**

- **Version name:** User-facing version string (e.g., "1.2.3") configured in WaveMaker project `config.xml`
- **Version code (Android):** Integer that must increase with each release (e.g., 1, 2, 3...)
- **Build number (iOS):** Must increase with each App Store submission

**Update workflow:**

1. Update version numbers in WaveMaker project configuration (`config.xml`)
2. Export updated React Native zip from WaveMaker Studio
3. Upload to AppChef and configure build with same certificates used for initial release
4. Unlock certificates by providing passwords (automatically locked after 24 hours)
5. Build and download updated signed APK/AAB (Android) or IPA (iOS)
6. Upload to Play Console or App Store Connect
7. Configure release notes describing changes
8. Submit for review (iOS always reviewed, Android typically faster automated review)
9. Release to users using same deployment strategy as initial release

**Best practices:**

- Maintain clear versioning strategy across all builds
- Test updates on beta channels first (Play Internal/Closed testing, TestFlight) before production
- Use AppChef QR codes for rapid internal testing of update builds
- Monitor crash reports and feedback immediately post-update
- Plan rollback strategy if critical issues emerge (cannot force downgrade, must release new fix)
- Communicate update changes to users through detailed release notes
- Keep certificates backed up externally and synchronized in AppChef
- Re-upload certificates to AppChef if they expire or are renewed
