# Building War from Studio

## Overview

WaveMaker allows you to generate a **WAR (Web Application Archive)** directly from the Studio using the **Project as WAR** option. This approach is suitable when you want to package the application using the build configuration defined within the Studio.

---

## Introduction

A WAR build packages the WaveMaker web application into a single deployable archive. The build process uses a selected **configuration profile**, which determines the build options and environment-specific settings applied during the build.

---

## Generate WAR Using WaveMaker Studio

To generate a WAR file from the WaveMaker Studio:

1. Open your application in **WaveMaker Studio**
2. Click on **Export Project**
3. Select **Project as WAR**
4. Choose the required **configuration profile** (for example, `development`, `deployment`, or a custom profile)
5. Start the export process

The WAR file is generated based on the selected profile and its configured build options.
