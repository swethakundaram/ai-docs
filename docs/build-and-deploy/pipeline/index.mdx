A pipeline handles the build, test, and deployment flow for a WaveMaker application across environments. It removes manual steps and ensures controlled, repeatable releases from development to production.

WaveMaker supports two delivery models:
- **WaveMaker Internal CI/CD Pipeline** – a managed pipeline that runs entirely inside the WaveMaker platform.
- **External CI/CD Pipeline Integration** – a bring-your-own-tools model that connects WaveMaker apps to an existing DevOps stack.

## WaveMaker Internal CI/CD Pipeline

Choose the internal pipeline when you want a ready-made workflow. WaveMaker orchestrates the entire CI/CD path, letting teams focus on application changes while the platform handles builds, packaging, and promotions.

**Typical stages**
- Development / Build – compile and package the application once.
- Testing or QA – run automated suites to validate the build.
- Staging – rehearse the release in a production-like environment.
- Production (Live) – deploy the vetted artifact to end users.

The same build artifact moves through every stage via deployment profiles. This keeps environments aligned and avoids surprises caused by rebuilding for each destination.

**Why teams use it**
- Minimal setup since the pipeline is managed by WaveMaker
- Pipeline status available directly in WaveMaker Studio and Apps Portal

## External CI/CD Pipeline Integration

External integration is for teams that already run their own CI/CD tooling. WaveMaker remains the development environment, but your existing services take care of orchestration.

**How it works**
- Keep application source in your version control system.
- Trigger builds and quality checks through your CI tool, such as Jenkins.
- Script packaging, security scans, and approvals to match internal policies.
- Deploy artifacts to platforms you manage, like Kubernetes clusters or on-prem infrastructure.

## Choosing a Pipeline Model

- Select the **Internal CI/CD Pipeline** when you want WaveMaker to manage builds and promotions with the least amount of setup.
- Select **External CI/CD Integration** when you need complete ownership of tooling, infrastructure, and deployment workflows.
