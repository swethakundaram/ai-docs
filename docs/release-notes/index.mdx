WaveMaker follows a predictable, transparent, and standard release strategy that balances rapid innovation with enterprise-grade stability.  
Our release model enables teams to confidently adopt new capabilities while ensuring long-term reliability for production applications.

This page provides a high-level overview of how WaveMaker releases work, how versions are managed, and how release policies differ between **WaveMaker Online (WMO)** and **WaveMaker Enterprise (WME)**.

## Versioning Philosophy

WaveMaker follows a versioning approach that is closely aligned with **[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/)**.
Each WaveMaker release follows the format:

### Version Components

- **MAJOR**  
  Introduced for significant platform-level changes, architectural upgrades, or foundational enhancements.

- **MINOR**  
  Introduced for new features, functional enhancements, and meaningful improvements that remain backward compatible.

- **PATCH**  
  Introduced for bug fixes, performance optimizations, and security updates with no breaking changes.

This structure helps teams clearly understand the **scope, impact, and upgrade expectations** of every release.

## Release Cadence

WaveMaker follows a steady and predictable release cadence, with flexibility based on quality and platform readiness.

### Patch Releases
- **Frequency:** Approximately every 2 weeks  
- **Focus:**  
  - Bug fixes  
  - Security patches  
  - Minor enhancements  

### Major & Minor Releases
- **Frequency:** Approximately every 3 months  
- **Focus:**  
  - New features  
  - Platform enhancements  
  - Developer experience improvements  

Wherever possible, **backward compatibility is preserved**, and platform-managed migrations ensure smooth upgrades.
