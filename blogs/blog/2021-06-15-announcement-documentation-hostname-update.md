<!-- truncate -->

As a part of brand unification, our digital team has been working hard to create a better online experience for our customers. For this reason, we are moving to a new domain for WaveMaker Documentation.

Starting June 21, 2021, our new domain for Documentation will be **[docs.wavemaker.com/learn](https://docs.wavemaker.com/learn/)**. 

### RSS Feed

If you have subscribed to our Team Blog via RSS feed, we request you to update the feed URL to continue to receive news and updates from our Engineering team.

#### Updated URL

```
https://docs.wavemaker.com/blog/feed.xml
```

Alternatively, find the updated URL when you navigate to **[blogs](/blog)** as well, as shown below.

Though there are no other significant changes in the layout and context, we have made it just a little easier for our customers and clients to find us online and convey a more cohesive brand identity.
