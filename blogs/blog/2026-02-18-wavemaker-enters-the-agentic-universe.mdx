### Fast-paced AI code generation

AI generated code is taking over the developer written code, almost 40% of code is generated by AI coding tools & vibe coding platforms today. As more code gets produced faster, reviewing and validating its production readiness becomes a huge challenge for development teams.

While skilled developers, experienced in building frameworks and those who imbibed architectural best practices over the years are able to achieve dramatic gains in productivity, the rest of the developer community has mixed reactions with AI. Prototypes get built lightning fast, but to take these to production is a bohemeth task in getting the architecture and alignment to existing organization principles right.

At WaveMaker, we are focused in creating the right foundation for AI-accelerated development, with an Architecture First approach and achieving deterministic outcomes with LLMs.

### Built on a strong foundation

Over the last decade, WaveMaker helped development teams to modernize their app solutions and products which needed experience-driven pixel-perfect UI, heavy customization for each deployment, high scalability and rigid security for regulated industries like BFSI, telecom, supply chain, healthcare etc.

WaveMaker enabled large organizations to build several multi-platform web and mobile app solutions, which require collaboration across engineering, design, customer implementation and partner development teams.

In such highly collaborative and cross-functional environments, WaveMaker platform provides alignment in terms of:
1. Technology stack
2. Design systems
3. Composability & Reusability
4. Enterprise guardrails & best practices
5. Seamless integration with existing SDLC processes

## WaveMaker AI 
WaveMaker AI is a step forward to bring design systems, proven architectures and enterprise guardrails into development projects, with significant boosts in developer productivity when using AI.

### Design System
Design Systems provide a single source of truth for design decisions that are made as part of the digital transformation and UI modernization projects. As the organizations grow and scale, development teams need to deal with:
- very complex UI screens
- intricate component customization
- high expectations on UI experience and performance
- heavy integrations to support security and scalability needs
- frequent rollouts (or point-releases)

### What does the AI Platform offer
Platform focuses on 3 key areas to provide acceleration to the development teams:
1. **Design to code automation**, creates a working Design System for developers
2. **Squad of AI Agents** for SDLC workflows, with standards based app generation
3. **Integrated Studio experience** to develop, test, configure & deploy apps

![Three Pillars](../../docs/release-notes/release-version-1/assets/images/1-ThreePillar.png)

A hybrid development environment that combines autonomous design to code AI that converts design to working application, Agents that carry out development tasks enforcing architecture, enterprise guardrails, and an integrated Studio environment for developers to fine-tune and override.

## 1. Design to code Automation
WaveMaker Autocode converts Figma designs to a working application using AI, 
- **Layouting**: by recreating the layouts from design
- **Components**: mapping UI elements to the UI components and 
- **Design Tokens**: mapping styles to the design tokens

### Layouts & Design tokens
Platform provides advanced layouting capability using Container Auto-Layout, UI Components provide design tokens to style every aspect and Components adhere to the Material Design principles. All these capabilities enable seamless conversion of Figma designs using AI, at a granular level and with high fidelity.

### UI Components
WM UI component library has evolved over the past decade supporting complex customization, security, accessibility and modern experience needs. Components are built for popular UI frameworks such as Angular, React for web & React Native for mobile.

### The two-pass approach
WaveMaker uses a highly sophisticated 2-pass generation technique to make AI conversion predictable and reliable.
- **1st pass**: Figma designs are translated to an intermediate WaveMaker meta markup language (WML), which identifies UI Components, properties and design tokens using AI/LLM
- **2nd pass**: WaveMaker Markup (WML) is then converted to working Angular, React or React Native app code, using WaveMaker code generators and LLMs

## 2. Squad of Developer Agents for App Generation

WaveMaker AIRA Agents brings AI-driven speed to enterprise application development with developer control and transparency without compromising on code quality, security, or architectural integrity. Every agent workflow is reviewable, reversible, and fully traceable, giving teams the confidence to adopt AI at scale.

Developer agents in WaveMaker generate predictable code output due to the 2-pass technique, reducing the cognitive load for developers to deal with huge amounts of AI-generated code. 

### MCP framework
Built on Model Context Protocol (MCP) framework, AI agents operate with deep, real-time application context providing access to relevant code, app artifacts, platform knowledge, and enterprise standards ensuring accurate, governed, and production ready outcomes

### Multi-Agent System
Each developer task is broken down into sub-tasks, orchestrating task completion across multiple agents and generating coherent output. Agents retain context and make it easier to build apps through simple prompts, to complete both common and complex development tasks, without compromising quality or control.

### Architectural integrity
Developer Agents operate inside your application and are made aware of Design System, separation of UI layers, API and backend microservices, scalable architecture principles and secure practices. These Agents generate production-ready and open standards code while keeping developers in control of every decision.

## 3. WYSIWYG Studio for Authoring and finer control
WYSIWYG Studio offers visual validation of development activities and better collaboration across design, engineering and business teams. WaveMaker focuses in reducing the developer skills needed to build complex, scalable, multi-platform applications in large organizations.

### WaveMaker Markup Language (WML)
WML not only simplifies AI code generation, it has enabled developers to visually create layouts, drag-n-drop components and fine-tune their look-n-feel requirements. Over the years, WML evolved and enabled developing highly customizable ISV solutions and enterprise applications.

### Human-in-the-loop
Visual canvas for page editing, Style workspace for editing the Design System and code editors for manually writing code. Studio provides human-in-the-loop control for developers to fine tune and refine AI generated output, while simultaneously taking advantage of automation with LLMs and agents.

## Paving the way for future of app development
In the era of AI code generation, developer ecosystem really needs a much stronger foundation in terms of architecture, design principles, open standards based frameworks and well-adopted industry trends to build app solutions.

WaveMaker empowers developers to really focus on their business objectives and goals for app modernization, while the platform takes care of architecture and guardrails, bringing true AI transformation to scale developer productivity.
